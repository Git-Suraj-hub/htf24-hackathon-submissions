**Project Title**
JarvisAI

**Project Description**
The project I created is a voice-activated assistant application named CodeCapture, designed to streamline various tasks such as opening websites and applications through voice commands. The application features a user-friendly GUI developed using PyQt5, showcasing animated GIFs to enhance the user experience. It integrates with the speech recognition library to convert voice input into commands, allowing users to effortlessly interact with their devices.

Inspiration behind the Project
The reason I chose this idea/project was to explore the intersection of voice recognition technology and user interface design. I aimed to create a tool that simplifies daily tasks and enhances productivity, making technology more accessible through voice commands.

**Tech Stack**
The technologies I used include:

PyQt5: For building the graphical user interface.
Speech Recognition: To process and understand voice commands.
Webbrowser Module: To open websites.
Operating System Module: To interact with system applications like Notepad.
Usage of Appwrite
Appwrite Databases: I used Appwrite Databases to manage user preferences and settings, allowing personalized experiences for different users.
Appwrite Storage: I used Appwrite Storage to host animated GIFs and other media assets for the application, ensuring quick access and seamless performance.
